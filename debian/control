Package: liblzma0
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: high compression-ratio compression library - runtime
 liblzma is a library implementing the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain
 compression method found in xz, lzma, and 7-Zip.  This package
 includes the shared library.
 .
 This library does not support 7-Zip's LZMA-based .7z format (for
 that, see p7zip).  This library's native file format is .xz, but
 the old .lzma format and raw (no headers) streams are also
 supported.
 .
 Compression is generally good (on par with or better than bzip2),
 decompression fast, and RAM usage high during compression and low
 during decompression.

Package: xz-utils
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: xz-lzma
Description: high compression-ratio compressor
 This package includes the xz compression tool and other command
 line tools for working with files compressed with the
 Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain compression method.  It supports two
 formats: .xz and the legacy .lzma format.  Commands provided
 include xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on.
 .
 For commands such as lzma and lzgrep, emulating the interface of
 LZMA Utils, see the xz-lzma package.
 .
 The primary algorithm supported by the .xz format is the LZMA2
 algorithm.  Compression is generally good (on par with or better
 than bzip2), decompression fast, and RAM usage high during
 compression and low during decompression.

Package: xz-lzma
Architecture: any
Pre-Depends: xz-utils, ${shlibs:Depends}
Depends: liblzma0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: lzma (<< 4.43-15)
Provides: lzma
Description: high compression-ratio compressor - compatibility commands
 This package provides lzma, unlzma, lzcat, and other command line
 tools emulating the interface of the legacy LZMA Utils package.
 .
 Since the commands in xz-utils handle the .lzma format already,
 you should only need this package if you have scripts or other
 programs requiring the legacy interface.

Package: liblzma-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: liblzma0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: liblzma-doc
Description: high compression-ratio compression library - development
 liblzma is a data compression library with support for several
 filters (algorithm implementations).  The primary filter is LZMA2,
 an extended version of the compression method used in lzma and 7-Zip.
 This package includes the development support files.
 .
 This library does not support 7-Zip's LZMA-based .7z format (for
 that, see p7zip).  This library's native file format is .xz, but
 the old .lzma format and raw (no headers) streams are also
 supported.
 .
 Compression is generally good (on par with or better than bzip2),
 decompression fast, and RAM usage high during compression and low
 during decompression.

Package: liblzma-doc
Section: doc
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: liblzma-dev
Description: high compression-ratio compression library - reference documentation
 This package contains documentation for developers using the liblzma
 data compression library.
 .
 Currently it contains only the Doxygen-generated API reference in
 HTML format.  The purpose of each struct, macro, and function in the
 public interface is explained here, but for an overview of XZ Utils
 one would have to look elsewhere.
