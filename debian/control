Description: high compression-ratio compression library - runtime
 liblzma is a library implementing the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain
 compression method found in xz, lzma, and 7-Zip.  This package
 includes the shared library.
 .
 This library does not support 7-Zip's LZMA-based .7z format (for
 that, see p7zip).  This library's native file format is .xz, but the
 old .lzma format and raw (no headers) streams are also supported.
 .
 Compression is generally good (on par with or better than bzip2),
 decompression fast, and RAM usage high during compression and low
 during decompression.

Description: high compression-ratio compressor
 XZ Utils is a set of gzip-style tools for working with files 
 compressed with the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain compression method.
 It supports two formats: .xz and the older .lzma format.  Thus
 it provides two sets of commands: xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and
 so on; and lzma, unlzma, lzcat, lzgrep, etc.
 .
 Compression is generally good (on par with or better than bzip2),
 decompression fast, and RAM usage high during compression and low
 during decompression.

Description: high compression-ratio compression library - development
 liblzma is an encoder/decoder library with support for several
 filters (algorithm implementations). The primary filter is LZMA2,
 an extended version of the compression method used in lzma and 7-Zip.
 This package includes the development support files.
 .
 This library does not support 7-Zip's LZMA-based .7z format (for
 that, see p7zip).  This library's native file format is .xz, but the
 old .lzma format and raw (no headers) streams are also supported.

Description: high compression-ratio compression library - reference documentation
 This package contains documentation for developers using the liblzma
 data compression library.
 .
 Currently it contains only the Doxygen-generated API reference in
 HTML format.  The purpose of each struct, macro, and function in the
 public interface is explained here, but for an overview of XZ Utils
 one would have to look elsewhere.
