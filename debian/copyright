it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

Most of the source files in this package are licensed under more
permissive terms.

| Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
| is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
| package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
| 
|   - liblzma is in the public domain.
| 
|   - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
|     domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
|     in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
|     GNU LGPLv2.1+.
| 
|   - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
|     adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
|     under GNU GPLv2+.
| 
|   - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
|     XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
|     are in the public domain.
| 
|   - Translated messages are in the public domain.
| 
|   - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
|     are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
|     in the binaries being built.
| 
|   - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
|     utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
| 
|   - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
|     that are under various free software licenses.
| 
| You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
| the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
| take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
| the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
| lawyers.
| 
| As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
| 
| If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
| into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
| polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
| naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
| notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:
| 
|     This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.
| 
| The following license texts are included in the following files:
|   - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
|   - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
|   - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
| 
| Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
| pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
| binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
| even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
| package.
| 
| If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
| information.

Although the source code to xz, liblzma, xzdec, lzmadec, and lzmainfo
is in the public domain, the object code is linked against the GNU C
library, use of which is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License, version 2.1 or later.

On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1 can be found in ‘/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-2.1’.

The Debian packaging files are in the public domain.  You may freely
use, modify, and distribute them.

| COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not
| clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put
| copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.
|
| I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public
| domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files
| generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-
| generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but
| it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some
| copyrighted content into the generated files.

The copyright status of these binaries is described in changelog.gz
(commit 975d8fd):

| Recreated the BCJ test files for x86 and SPARC. The old files
| were linked with crt*.o, which are copyrighted, and thus the
| old test files were not in the public domain as a whole. They
| are freely distributable though, but it is better to be careful
| and avoid including any copyrighted pieces in the test files.
| The new files are just compiled and assembled object files,
| and thus don't contain any copyrighted code.

 All the test files (*.xz) and this README have
 been put into the public domain.

These config.h files contain no copyright notice.  The comments they
contain are copied by autoconf from configure.ac, GNU Autoconf, and

configure.ac was written by Lasse Collin and is in the public domain.

The comments from Autoconf were written by Roland McGrath, Akim
Demaille, Paul Eggert, David Mackenzie, and many others.
