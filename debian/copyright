X-Authors:
 XZ Utils is developed and maintained upstream by Lasse Collin.  Major
 portions are based on code by other authors; see AUTHORS for details.
 Most of the source is in the public domain, but some files are
 copyrighted (details below).
X-License: GPL-3+
 This package is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 .
 On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General Public License
 version 3 can be found in ‘/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3’.
 .
 Most files in this package are licensed with more permissive terms.
 See X-COPYING below for details.
 .
 Although the source code to xz, liblzma, xzdec, lzmadec, and lzmainfo
 is in the public domain, the object code is linked against the GNU C
 library, use of which is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
 License, version 2.1 or later.
 .
 On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License version 2.1 can be found in ‘/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-2.1’.
X-COPYING:
 Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
 is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
 package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
 .
   - liblzma is in the public domain.
 .
   - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
     domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
     in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
     GNU LGPLv2.1+.
 .
   - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
     adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
     under GNU GPLv2+.
 .
   - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
     XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
     are in the public domain.
 .
   - Translated messages are in the public domain.
 .
   - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
     are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
     in the binaries being built.
 .
   - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
     utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
 .
   - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
     that are under various free software licenses.
 .
 You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
 the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
 take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
 the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
 lawyers.
 .
 As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
 .
 If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
 into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
 polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
 naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
 notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:
 .
     This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.
 .
 The following license texts are included in the following files:
   - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
   - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
   - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
 .
 Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
 pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
 binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
 even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
 package.
 .
 If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
 information.

 COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not
 clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put
 copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.
 .
 I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public
 domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files
 generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-
 generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but
 it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some
 copyrighted content into the generated files.

 From changelog.gz (commit 975d8fd):
 .
 | Recreated the BCJ test files for x86 and SPARC. The old files
 | were linked with crt*.o, which are copyrighted, and thus the
 | old test files were not in the public domain as a whole. They
 | are freely distributable though, but it is better to be careful
 | and avoid including any copyrighted pieces in the test files.
 | The new files are just compiled and assembled object files,
 | and thus don't contain any copyrighted code.
