XZ Utils for Debian
-------------------

XZ Utils should have been called LZMA Utils 4.42, but it came too late.
The old .lzma file format has some problems, worst of which is the lack
of magic number, but it gets enough use to still need to be supported.
See /usr/share/doc/xz-utils/history.txt.gz for the full story.

To avoid a conflict with lzip 1.7, the lzgrep and lzdiff commands are
not included in the xz-lzma Debian package.  Use xzgrep and xzdiff
instead.  (Alternatively, if a command named lzdiff to compare .lzma
files is desperately needed, you can provide a symbolic link pointing to
/usr/bin/xzdiff locally.)

Some of the documentation refers to COPYING and COPYING.GPLv2/3/LGPLv2.1
files from the source distribution.  On Debian systems, their content can
be found under different names:

 * upstreamâ€™s COPYING is included in /usr/share/doc/xz-utils/copyright
 * for COPYING.GPLv2, see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2
 * for COPYING.GPLv3, see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3
 * for COPYING.LGPLv2.1, see /usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-2.1

If you would like to help develop XZ Utils, see TODO in the xz-utils
source package.  (That file is also installed with the liblzma-dev
documentation.)
