xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100212-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Starting with this version, the lzma_block_header_decode() function
  is advertised to require its block->version parameter to be initialized.
  Future versions of liblzma may use an alternate version of the Block
  options if the application declares it supports it.  Existing applications
  will continue to work for now because the only supported Block format
  version is zero.
