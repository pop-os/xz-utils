xz-utils (4.999.9beta-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Nieder ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #540543, #541391, #541540)
  * Update and clarify copyright file.
  * Split out lzma compatibility commands as new xz-lzma package.
  * Avoid conflict between xz-lzma and lzma:
     - Use update-alternatives to provide lzma, unlzma, and lzcat.
     - debian/control: xz-lzma only conflicts with lzma versions
       before 4.43-15, when it started using update-alternatives
       to provide lzma, unlzma, and lzcat. (Closes: #542060)
  * Avoid conflict between xz-lzma and lzip 1.7:
     - Do not install lzdiff and lzgrep commands. (Closes: #540232)
     - Add a note to README.Debian explaining how to get lzdiff and
       lzgrep commands if old scripts require them.
  * debian/control: Add information about the packaging Git repository.
  * debian/control: Clarify package descriptions.
  * debian/README.source: Clarify build instructions.
  * Add debian/.gitignore listing build products.
  * Build xz-utils with static liblzma.
     - debian/rules: Use configure --enable-dynamic=mixed.
  * Optimize xzdec and lzmadec for size, following suggestion in
    PACKAGERS.
     - debian/rules: Build xzdec and lzmadec separately so they can
       be optimized for size.
     - debian/control: Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 7.3.0).
  * Generate upstream changelog instead of shipping placeholder.
     - debian/README.source: Add instructions for regenerating upstream
       changelog file.
     - debian/changelog.upstream.sh: New script.
     - debian/rules: Install generated changelog file.
  * liblzma-dev: Add short README.Debian with pointers to documentation.
  * Drop debian/xzdec.1, since upstream ships a better man page.
  * Run autotools at build time.
     + debian/control:
        - Build-Depends: autoconf, automake, libtool, gettext
        - Build-Conflicts: autoconf2.13, automake1.4
     + debian/rules:
        - configure: autoreconf -fi
        - clean: remove autotools-generated files to avoid .diff.gz
          changes when built twice in a row.
  * debian/rules: Add get-orig-source target.
  * Prepare for upload to experimental.

  [ Cristian Greco ]
  * debian/copyright: refer to versioned GPL-3 file.
  * debian/control: remove duplicate field ‘section’ in package xz-utils.

xz-utils (4.999.8beta-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Nieder ]
  * Initial package for Debian. (Closes: #518803)
     + debian/rules:
        - add minimal rules file (using Debhelper 7), a control file
          describing the binary packages, and an appropriate compat file.
        - use configure --enable-dynamic; use up-to-date config.guess and
          config.sub files.
        - do not run automake and so on on autobuilders. Instead, we can
          run them ourselves when we build the source package.
     + debian/README.source:
        - add informations about the packaging GIT repository.
  * Add liblzma-doc package with Doxygen-generated API docs.

  * Prepare for upload to experimental.
